# VM Practices

1) Create a Windows VM with Azure CLI - then stop it, then start it.  Then install IIS on it.
2) Using Azure Portal, Create a generalized Image of previous VM.
3) Using Azure Portal Create a new VM from Generalized Image
4) Create a snapshot of previous VHD
5) Restore VHD from snapshot
6) Azure CLI deallocate it newly created VM



Figure out what stays in create image?
