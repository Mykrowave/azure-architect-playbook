# Budget Monitoring  


## Azure Advisor  
Azure Advisor can offer some assistance on recommendations to save costs. Dont rely on it, but it's not a bad place to start if you are looking to fine tune costs.  

## Billing and Cost Management  

1) Estimate before provisioning. Azure Pricing calculator does a good job, or if you have an Enterprise Agreement, view and download the Azure Price Sheet.  
2) Create a Budget and set up Cost Alerts to get more control and transparency of billing.  Cloud Pricing is super variable.  Stay on top of it  
3) You can integrate with Azure's billing and consumption API's.  

## SideNotes

- To view costs, you need account or subscription level access to cost or billing info  
- If there is a service incident, you can request a SLA credit through submitting a suppport request.
