- not a monolithic application (deployment, scaling, load balancing, logging, monitoring are all optional
- team needs to understand microservice arch
- deployment is configred as a cluster (at least one master machine and one or more worker machines)
- YOU are responsible for maintaining Cluster - manage OS upgrades, networking, memory, storage, etc

## Azure Kubernetes
