# Docker
- Docker much more light weight than VM
- Docker containers share the underlying resources and libraries (so not isolated by physical means as opposed to VMs that are)

## Azure Container Instances
- Run Containers here


## Docker Docker Registry
- Azure Container Registry and Docker Hub
- Many organizations publish docker images to DockerHub (it's public and free with account)
- Need Registry, repository, and version tag to get image you want
